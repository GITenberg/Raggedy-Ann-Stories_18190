<h2><a name="PREFACE_AND_DEDICATION" id="PREFACE_AND_DEDICATION"></a>PREFACE AND DEDICATION</h2>


<p>As I write this, I have before me on my desk, propped up against the
telephone, an old rag doll. Dear old Raggedy Ann!</p>

<p>The same Raggedy Ann with which my mother played when a child.</p>

<p>There she sits, a trifle loppy and loose-jointed, looking me squarely in
the face in a straightforward, honest manner, a twinkle where her
shoe-button eyes reflect the electric light.</p>

<p>Evidently Raggedy has been to a "tea party" today, for her face is
covered with chocolate.</p>

<p>She smiles happily and continuously.</p>

<p>True, she has been nibbled by mice, who have made nests out of the soft
cotton with which she has been stuffed, but Raggedy smiled just as
broadly when the mice nibbled at her, for her smile is painted on.</p>

<p>What adventures you must have had, Raggedy!</p>

<p>What joy and happiness you have brought into this world!</p>

<p>And no matter what treatment you have received, how patient you have
been!</p>

<p>What lessons of kindness and fortitude you might teach could you but
talk; you with your wisdom of fifty-nine years. No wonder Rag Dolls are
the best beloved! You are so kindly, so patient, so lovable.</p>

<p>The more you become torn, tattered and loose-jointed, Rag Dolls, the
more you are loved by children.</p>

<p>Who knows but that Fairyland is filled with old, lovable Rag
Dolls&mdash;soft, loppy Rag Dolls who ride through all the wonders of
Fairyland in the crook of dimpled arms, snuggling close to childish
breasts within which beat hearts filled with eternal sunshine.</p>

<p>So, to the millions of children and grown-ups who have loved a Rag Doll,
I dedicate these stories of Raggedy Ann.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>Marcella liked to play up in the attic at Grandma's quaint old house,
'way out in the country, for there were so many old forgotten things to
find up there.</p>

<p>One day when Marcella was up in the attic and had played with the old
spinning wheel until she had grown tired of it, she curled up on an old
horse-hair sofa to rest.</p>

<p>"I wonder what is in that barrel, 'way back in the corner?" she thought,
as she jumped from the sofa and climbed over two dusty trunks to the
barrel standing back under the eaves.</p>

<p>It was quite dark back there, so when Marcella had pulled a large bundle
of things from the barrel she took them over to the dormer window where
she could see better. There was a funny little bonnet with long white
ribbons. Marcella put it on.</p>

<p>In an old leather bag she found a number of tin-types of queer looking
men and women in old-fashioned clothes. And there was one picture of a
very pretty little girl with long curls tied tightly back from her
forehead and wearing a long dress and queer pantaloons which reached to
her shoe-tops. And then out of the heap she pulled an old rag doll with
only one shoe-button eye and a painted nose and a smiling mouth. Her
dress was of soft material, blue with pretty little flowers and dots all
over it.</p>

<p>Forgetting everything else in the happiness of her find, Marcella caught
up the rag doll and ran downstairs to show it to Grandma.</p>

<p>"Well! Well! Where did you find it?" Grandma cried. "It's old Raggedy
Ann!" she went on as she hugged the doll <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>to her breast. "I had
forgotten her. She has been in the attic for fifty years, I guess! Well!
Well! Dear old Raggedy Ann! I will sew another button on her right
away!" and Grandma went to the machine drawer and got her needle and
thread.</p>

<p>Marcella watched the sewing while Grandma told how she had played with
Raggedy Ann when she was a little girl.</p>

<p>"Now!" Grandma laughed, "Raggedy Ann, you have two fine shoe-button eyes
and with them you can see the changes that have taken place in the world
while you have been shut up so long in the attic! For, Raggedy Ann, you
have a new playmate and mistress now, and I hope you both will have as
much happiness together as you and I used to have!"</p>

<p>Then Grandma gave Raggedy Ann to Marcella, saying very seriously,
"Marcella, let me introduce my very dear friend, Raggedy Ann. Raggedy,
this is my grand-daughter, Marcella!" And Grandma gave the doll a twitch
with her fingers in such a way that the rag doll nodded her head to
Marcella.</p>

<p>"Oh, Grandma! Thank you ever and ever so much!" Marcella cried as she
gave Grandma a hug and kiss. "Raggedy Ann and I will have just loads of
fun."</p>

<p>And this is how Raggedy Ann joined the doll family at Marcella's house,
where she began the adventures of Raggedy Ann, told in the following
stories.</p>

<h2><a name="RAGGEDY_ANN_LEARNS_A_LESSON" id="RAGGEDY_ANN_LEARNS_A_LESSON"></a>RAGGEDY ANN LEARNS A LESSON</h2>


<p>One day the dolls were left all to themselves.</p>

<p>Their little mistress had placed them all around the room and told them
to be nice children while she was away.</p>

<p>And there they sat and never even so much as wiggled a finger, until
their mistress had left the room.</p>

<p>Then the soldier dolly turned his head and solemnly winked at Raggedy
Ann.</p>

<p>And when the front gate clicked and the dollies knew they were alone in
the house, they all scrambled to their feet.</p>

<p>"Now let's have a good time!" cried the tin soldier. "Let's all go in
search of something to eat!"</p>

<p>"Yes! Let's all go in search of something to eat!" cried all the other
dollies.</p>

<p>"When Mistress had me out playing with her this morning," said Raggedy
Ann, "she carried me by a door near the back of the house and I smelled
something which smelled as if it would taste delicious!"</p>

<p>"Then you lead the way, Raggedy Ann!" cried the French dolly.</p>

<p>"I think it would be a good plan to elect Raggedy Ann as our leader on
this expedition!" said the Indian doll.</p>

<p>At this all the other dolls clapped their hands together and shouted,
"Hurrah! Raggedy Ann will be our leader."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>So Raggedy Ann, very proud indeed to have the confidence and love of all
the other dollies, said that she would be very glad to be their leader.</p>

<p>"Follow me!" she cried as her wobbly legs carried her across the floor
at a lively pace.</p>

<p>The other dollies followed, racing about the house until they came to
the pantry door. "This is the place!" cried Raggedy Ann, and sure
enough, all the dollies smelled something which they knew must be very
good to eat.</p>

<p>But none of the dollies was tall enough to open the door and, although
they pushed and pulled with all their might, the door remained tightly
closed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 257px;">
<img src="images/s1a-tb.jpg" width="257" height="400" alt="Raggedy Ann can think clearly now." title="Raggedy Ann can think clearly now." />
</div>
<p>The dollies were talking and pulling and pushing and every once in a
while one would fall over and the others would step on her in their
efforts to open the door. Finally Raggedy Ann drew away from the others
and sat down on the floor.</p>

<p>When the other dollies discovered Raggedy Ann sitting there, running her
rag hands through her yarn hair, they knew she was thinking.</p>

<p>"Sh! Sh!" they said to each other and quietly went over near Raggedy Ann
and sat down in front of her.</p>

<p>"There must be a way to get inside," said Raggedy Ann.</p>

<p>"Raggedy says there must be a way to get inside!" cried all the dolls.</p>

<p>"I can't seem to think clearly to-day," said Raggedy Ann. "It feels as
if my head were ripped."</p>

<p>At this the French doll ran to Raggedy Ann and took off her bonnet.
"Yes, there is a rip in your head, Raggedy!" she said and pulled a pin
from her skirt and pinned up Raggedy's head. "It's not a very neat job,
for I got some puckers in it!" she said.</p>

<p>"Oh that is ever so much better!" cried Raggedy Ann. "Now I can think
quite clearly."</p>

<p>"Now Raggedy can think quite clearly!" cried all the dolls.</p>

<p>"My thoughts must have leaked out the rip before!" said Raggedy Ann.</p>


<p>"They must have leaked out before, dear Raggedy!" cried all the other
dolls.</p>

<p>"Now that I can think so clearly," said Raggedy Ann, "I think the door
must be locked and to get in we must unlock it!"</p>

<p>"That will be easy!" said the Dutch doll who says "Mamma" when he is
tipped backward and forward, "For we will have the brave tin soldier
shoot the key out of the lock!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/s1b-tb.jpg" width="400" height="246" alt="The Brave Tin Soldier" title="The Brave Tin Soldier" />
</div>

<p>"I can easily do that!" cried the tin soldier, as he raised his gun.</p>

<p>"Oh, Raggedy Ann!" cried the French dolly. "Please do not let him
shoot!"</p>

<p>"No!" said Raggedy Ann. "We must think of a quieter way!"</p>

<p>After thinking quite hard for a moment, Raggedy Ann jumped up and said:
"I have it!" And she caught up the Jumping Jack and held him up to the
door; then Jack slid up his stick and unlocked the door.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the dollies all pushed and the door swung open.</p>

<p>My! Such a scramble! The dolls piled over one another in their desire to
be the first at the goodies.</p>

<p>They swarmed upon the pantry shelves and in their eagerness spilled a
pitcher of cream which ran all over the French dolly's dress.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/s1c-tb.jpg" width="400" height="305" alt="Having tea" title="Having tea" />
</div>

<p>The Indian doll found some corn bread and dipping it in the molasses he
sat down for a good feast.</p>

<p>A jar of raspberry jam was overturned and the dollies ate of this until
their faces were all purple.</p>

<p>The tin soldier fell from the shelf three times and bent one of his tin
legs, but he scrambled right back up again.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p><div class="figright" style="width: 256px;">
<img src="images/s1d-tb.jpg" width="256" height="400" alt="Shame on you, Raggedy Ann!" title="Shame on you, Raggedy Ann!" />
</div>

<p>Never had the dolls had so much fun and excitement, and they had all
eaten their fill when they heard the click of the front gate.</p>


<p>They did not take time to climb from the shelves, but all rolled or
jumped off to the floor and scrambled back to their <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>room as fast as
they could run, leaving a trail of bread crumbs and jam along the way.</p>

<p>Just as their mistress came into the room the dolls dropped in whatever
positions they happened to be in.</p>

<p>"This is funny!" cried Mistress. "They were all left sitting in their
places around the room! I wonder if Fido has been shaking them up!" Then
she saw Raggedy Ann's face and picked her up. "Why Raggedy Ann, you are
all sticky! I do believe you are covered with jam!" and Mistress tasted
Raggedy Ann's hand. "Yes! It's JAM! Shame on you, Raggedy Ann! You've
been in the pantry and all the others, too!" and with this the dolls'
mistress dropped Raggedy Ann on the floor and left the room.</p>

<p>When she came back she had on an apron and her sleeves were rolled up.</p>

<p>She picked up all the sticky dolls and putting them in a basket she
carried them out under the apple tree in the garden.</p>

<p>There she had placed her little tub and wringer and she took the dolls
one at a time, and scrubbed them with a scrubbing brush and soused them
up and down and this way and that in the soap suds until they were
clean.</p>

<p>Then she hung them all out on the clothes-line in the sunshine to dry.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/s1c2.jpg" width="400" height="137" alt="Hanging in a row." title="Hanging in a row." />
</div>


<p>There the dolls hung all day, swinging and twisting about as the breeze
swayed the clothes-line.</p>

<p>"I do believe she scrubbed my face so hard she wore off my smile!" said
Raggedy Ann, after an hour of silence.</p>





<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>"No, it is still there!" said the tin solder, as the wind twisted him
around so he could see Raggedy. "But I do believe my arms will never
work without squeaking, they feel so rusted," he added.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 255px;">
<img src="images/s1e-tb.jpg" width="255" height="400" alt="A proper tea-party" title="A proper tea-party" />
</div>
<p>Just then the wind twisted the little Dutch doll and loosened his
clothes-pin, so that he fell to the grass below with a sawdusty bump and
as he rolled over he said, "Mamma!" in a squeaky voice.</p>


<p>Late in the afternoon the back door opened and the little mistress came
out with a table and chairs. After setting the table she took all the
dolls from the line and placed them about the table.</p>

<p>They had lemonade with grape jelly in it, which made it a beautiful
lavender color, and little "Baby-teeny-weeny-cookies" with powdered
sugar on them.</p>

<p>After this lovely dinner, the dollies were taken in the house, where
they had their hair brushed and nice clean nighties put on.</p>

<p>Then they were placed in their beds and Mistress kissed each one good
night and tiptoed from the room.</p>

<p>All the dolls lay as still as mice for a few minutes, then Raggedy Ann
raised up on her cotton-stuffed elbows and said: "I have been thinking!"</p>

<p>"Sh!" said all the other dollies, "Raggedy has been thinking!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Raggedy Ann, "I have been thinking; our mistress gave us the
nice dinner out under the trees to teach us a lesson. She wished us to
know that we could have had all the goodies we wished, whenever we
wished, if we had behaved ourselves. And our lesson was that we must
never take without asking what we could always have for the asking! So
let us all remember and try never again to do anything which might cause
those who love us any unhappiness!"</p>

<p>"Let us all remember," chimed all the other dollies.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>And Raggedy Ann, with a merry twinkle in her shoe-button eyes, lay back
in her little bed, her cotton head filled with thoughts of love and
happiness.</p>

<p>"Why, Dinah! How could you!"</p>

<p>Mamma looked out of the window and saw Marcella run up to Dinah and take
something out of her hand and then put her head in her arm and commence
crying.</p>

<p>"What is the trouble, Dear?" Mamma asked, as she came out the door and
knelt beside the little figure shaking with sobs.</p>

<p>Marcella held out Raggedy Ann. But such a comical looking Raggedy Ann!</p>

<p>Mamma had to smile in spite of her sympathy, for Raggedy Ann looked
ridiculous!</p>

<p>Dinah's big eyes rolled out in a troubled manner, for Marcella had
snatched Raggedy Ann from Dinah's hand as she cried, "Why, Dinah! How
could you?"</p>

<p>Dinah could not quite understand and, as she dearly loved Marcella, she
was troubled.</p>

<p>Raggedy Ann was not in the least downhearted and while she felt she must
look very funny she continued to smile, but with a more expansive smile
than ever before.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 256px;">
<img src="images/s3b.jpg" width="256" height="400" alt="In the wash" title="In the wash" />
</div>

<p>Raggedy Ann knew just how it all happened and her remaining shoe-button
eye twinkled.</p>

<p>She remembered that morning when Marcella came to the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>nursery to take
the nighties from the dolls and dress them she had been cross.</p>

<p>Raggedy Ann thought at the time "Perhaps she had climbed out of bed
backwards!" For Marcella complained to each doll as she dressed them.</p>

<p>And when it came Raggedy's time to be dressed, Marcella was very cross
for she had scratched her finger on a pin when dressing the French doll.</p>

<p>So, when Marcella heard the little girl next door calling to her, she
ran out of the nursery and gave Raggedy Ann a toss from her as she ran.</p>

<p>Now it happened Raggedy lit in the clothes hamper and there she lay all
doubled up in a knot.</p>

<p>A few minutes afterwards Dinah came through the hall with an armful of
clothes and piled them in the hamper on top of Raggedy Ann.</p>

<p>Then Dinah carried the hamper out in back of the house where she did the
washing.</p>

<p>Dinah dumped all the clothes into the boiler and poured water on them.</p>

<p>The boiler was then placed upon the stove.</p>

<p>When the water began to get warm, Raggedy Ann wiggled around and climbed
up amongst the clothes to the top of the boiler to peek out. There was
too much steam and she could see nothing. For that matter, Dinah could
not see Raggedy Ann, either, on account of the steam.</p>

<p>So Dinah, using an old broom handle, stirred the clothes in the boiler
and the clothes and Raggedy Ann were stirred and whirled around until
all were thoroughly boiled.</p>

<p>When Dinah took the clothes a piece at a time from the boiler and
scrubbed them, she finally came upon Raggedy Ann.</p>

<p>Now Dinah did not know but that Marcella had placed Raggedy in the
clothes hamper to be washed, so she soaped Raggedy well and scrubbed her
up and down over the rough wash-board.</p>



<p>Two buttons from the back of Raggedy's dress came off <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>and one of
Raggedy Ann's shoe-button eyes was loosened as Dinah gave her face a
final scrub.</p>



<p>Then Dinah put Raggedy Ann's feet in the wringer and turned the crank.
It was hard work getting Raggedy through the wringer, but Dinah was very
strong. And of course it happened! Raggedy Ann came through as flat as a
pancake.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/s3c.jpg" width="400" height="238" alt="Through the wringer" title="Through the wringer" />
</div>
<p>It was just then, that Marcella returned and saw Raggedy.</p>

<p>"Why, Dinah! How could you!" Marcella had sobbed as she snatched the
flattened Raggedy Ann from the bewildered Dinah's hand.</p>

<p>Mamma patted Marcella's hand and soon coaxed her to quit sobbing.</p>

<p>When Dinah explained that the first she knew of Raggedy being in the
wash was when she took her from the boiler, Marcella began crying again.</p>

<p>"It was all my fault, Mamma!" she cried. "I remember now that I threw
dear old Raggedy Ann from me as I ran out the door and she must have
fallen in the clothes hamper! Oh dear! Oh dear!" and she hugged Raggedy
Ann tight.</p>

<p>Mamma did not tell Marcella that she had been cross and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>naughty for she
knew Marcella felt very sorry. Instead Mamma put her arms around her and
said,</p>

<p>"Just see how Raggedy Ann takes it! She doesn't seem to be unhappy!"</p>

<p>And when Marcella brushed her tears away and looked at Raggedy Ann, flat
as a pancake and with a cheery smile upon her painted face, she had to
laugh. And Mamma and Dinah had to laugh, too, for Raggedy Ann's smile
was almost twice as broad as it had been before.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/s3d.jpg" width="400" height="309" alt="Back on the line" title="Back on the line" />
</div>
<p>"Just let me hang Miss Raggedy on the line in the bright sunshine for
half an hour," said Dinah, "and you won't know her when she comes off!"</p>

<p>So Raggedy Ann was pinned to the clothes-line, out in the bright
sunshine, where she swayed and twisted in the breeze and listened to the
chatter of the robins in a nearby tree.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>Every once in a while Dinah went out and rolled and patted Raggedy until
her cotton stuffing was soft and dry and fluffy and her head and arms
and legs were nice and round again.</p>

<p>Then she took Raggedy Ann into the house and showed Marcella and Mamma
how clean and sweet she was.</p>

<p>Marcella took Raggedy Ann right up to the nursery and told all the dolls
just what had happened and how sorry she was that she had been so cross
and peevish when she dressed them. And while the dolls said never a word
they looked at their little mistress with love in their eyes as she sat
in the little red rocking chair and held Raggedy Ann tightly in her
arms.</p>

<p>And Raggedy Ann's remaining shoe-button eye looked up at her little
mistress in rather a saucy manner, but upon her face was the same old
smile of happiness, good humor and love.</p>

<h2><a name="Raggedy_Ann_and_the_Kite" id="Raggedy_Ann_and_the_Kite"></a>RAGGEDY ANN AND THE KITE</h2>


<p>Raggedy Ann watched with interest the preparations.</p>

<p>A number of sticks were being fastened together with strings and covered
with light cloth.</p>

<p>Raggedy Ann heard some of the boys talk of "The Kite," so Raggedy Ann
knew this must be a kite.</p>

<p>When a tail had been fastened to the kite and a large ball of heavy
twine tied to the front, one of the boys held the kite up in the air and
another boy walked off, unwinding the ball of twine.</p>

<p>There was a nice breeze blowing, so the boy with the twine called, "Let
'er go" and started running.</p>

<p>Marcella held Raggedy up so that she could watch the kite sail through
the air.</p>

<p>How nicely it climbed! But suddenly the kite acted strangely, and as all
the children shouted advice to the boy with the ball of twine, the kite
began darting this way and that, and finally making four or five
loop-the-loops, it crashed to the ground.</p>

<p>"It needs more tail on it!" one boy shouted.</p>

<p>Then the children asked each other where they might get more rags to
fasten to the tail of the kite.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 251px;">
<img src="images/s4b.jpg" width="251" height="400" alt="Flying with the kite" title="Flying with the kite" />
</div>
<p>"Let's tie Raggedy Ann to the tail!" suggested Marcella. "I know she
would enjoy a trip 'way up in the sky!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys all shouted with delight at this new suggestion. So Raggedy Ann
was tied to the tail of the kite.</p>

<p>This time the kite rose straight in the air and remained steady. The boy
with the ball of twine unwound it until the kite and Raggedy Ann were
'way, 'way up and far away. How Raggedy Ann enjoyed being up there! She
could see for miles and miles! And how tiny the children looked!</p>

<p>Suddenly a great puff of wind came and carried Raggedy Ann streaming
'way out behind the kite! She could hear the wind singing on the twine
as the strain increased.</p>

<p>Suddenly Raggedy Ann felt something rip. It was the rag to which she was
tied. As each puff of wind caught her the rip widened.</p>

<p>When Marcella watched Raggedy Ann rise high above the field, she
wondered how much Raggedy Ann enjoyed it, and wished that she, too,
might have gone along. But after the kite had been up in the air for
five or ten minutes, Marcella grew restless. Kites were rather tiresome.
There was more fun in tea parties out under the apple tree.</p>

<p>"Will you please pull down the kite now?" she asked the boy with the
twine. "I want Raggedy Ann."</p>

<p>"Let her ride up there!" the boy replied. "We'll bring her home when we
pull down the kite! We're going to get another ball of twine and let her
go higher!"</p>

<p>Marcella did not like to leave Raggedy Ann with the boys, so she sat
down upon the ground to wait until they pulled down the kite.</p>

<p>But while Marcella watched Raggedy Ann, a dot in the sky, she could not
see the wind ripping the rag to which Raggedy was tied.</p>

<p>Suddenly the rag parted and Raggedy Ann went sailing away as the wind
caught in her skirts.</p>

<p>Marcella jumped from the ground, too surprised to say anything. The
kite, released from the weight of Raggedy Ann began darting and swooping
to the ground.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/s4c.jpg" width="400" height="245" alt="Where is Raggedy Ann?" title="Where is Raggedy Ann?" />
</div>

<p>"We'll get her for you!" some of the boys said when they saw Marcella's
troubled face, and they started running in the direction Raggedy Ann had
fallen. Marcella and the other girls ran with them. They ran, and they
ran, and they ran, and at last they found the kite upon the ground with
one of the sticks broken, but they could not find Raggedy Ann anywhere.</p>

<p>"She must have fallen almost in your yard!" a boy said to Marcella, "for
the kite was directly over here when the doll fell!"</p>

<p>Marcella was heartbroken. She went in the house and lay on the bed.
Mamma went out with the children and tried to find Raggedy Ann, but
Raggedy Ann was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>When Daddy came home in the evening he tried to find Raggedy, but met
with no success. Marcella had eaten hardly any dinner, nor could she be
comforted by Mamma or Daddy. The other dolls in the nursery lay
forgotten and were not put to bed that night, for Marcella lay and
sobbed and tossed about her bed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally she said a little prayer for Raggedy Ann, and went to sleep. And
as she slept Marcella dreamed that the fairies came and took Raggedy Ann
with them to fairyland for a visit, and then sent Raggedy Ann home to
her. She awakened with a cry. Of course Mamma came to her bed right away
and said that Daddy would offer a reward in the morning for the return
of Raggedy.</p>

<p>"It was all my fault, Mamma!" Marcella said. "I should not have offered
the boys dear old Raggedy Ann to tie on the tail of the kite! But I just
know the fairies will send her back."</p>

<p>Mamma took her in her arms and soothed her with cheering words, although
she felt indeed that Raggedy Ann was truly lost and would never be found
again.</p>

<p>Now, where do you suppose Raggedy Ann was all this time?</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/s4d.jpg" width="400" height="306" alt="Falling" title="Falling" />
</div>

<p>When Raggedy Ann dropped from the kite, the wind <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>caught in her skirts
and carried her along until she fell in the fork of the large elm tree
directly over Marcella's house. When Raggedy Ann fell with a thud, face
up in the fork of the tree, two robins who had a nest near by flew
chattering away.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 255px;">
<img src="images/s4e.jpg" width="255" height="400" alt="Raggedy Ann in the tree" title="Raggedy Ann in the tree" />
</div>

<p>Presently the robins returned and quarreled at Raggedy Ann for laying so
close to their nest, but Raggedy Ann only smiled at them and did not
move.</p>

<p>When the robins quieted down and quit their quarreling, one of them
hopped up closer to Raggedy Ann in order to investigate.</p>

<p>It was Mamma Robin. She called to Daddy Robin and told him to come. "See
the nice yarn! We could use it to line the nest with," she said.</p>

<p>So the robins hopped closer to Raggedy Ann and asked if they might have
some of her yarn hair to line their nest. Raggedy Ann smiled at them. So
the two robins pulled and tugged at Raggedy Ann's yarn hair until they
had enough to line their nest nice and soft.</p>

<p>Evening came and the robins sang their good night songs, and Raggedy Ann
watched the stars come out, twinkle all night and disappear in the
morning light. In the morning the robins again pulled yarn from Raggedy
Ann's head, and loosened her so she could peep over the side of the
limb, and when the sun came up Raggedy Ann saw she was in the trees in
her own yard.</p>

<p>Now before she could eat any breakfast, Marcella started out to find
Raggedy Ann. And, it was Marcella herself who found her. And this is how
she did it.</p>

<p>Mamma Robin had seen Marcella with Raggedy Ann out in the yard many
times, so she began calling "Cheery! Cheery!" and Daddy Robin started
calling "Cheery! Cheery! Cheer up! Cheer up! Cheerily Cheerily! Cheery!
Cheery!" And Marcella looking up into the tree above the house to see
the robins, discovered Raggedy Ann peeping over the limb at her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>



<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>Oh, how her heart beat with happiness. "Here is Raggedy Ann," she
shouted.</p>

<p>And Mamma and Daddy came out and saw Raggedy smiling at them, and Daddy
got the clothes prop and climbed out of the attic window and poked
Raggedy Ann out of the tree and she fell right into Marcella's arms
where she was hugged in a tight embrace.</p>

<p>"You'll never go up on a kite again, Raggedy Ann!" said Marcella, "for I
felt so lost without you. I will never let you leave me again."</p>

<p>So Raggedy Ann went into the house and had breakfast with her little
mistress and Mamma and Daddy smiled at each other when they peeped
through the door into the breakfast room, for Raggedy Ann's smile was
wide and very yellow. Marcella, her heart full of happiness, was feeding
Raggedy Ann part of her egg.</p>

<h2><a name="RAGGEDY_ANN_RESCUES_FIDO" id="RAGGEDY_ANN_RESCUES_FIDO"></a>RAGGEDY ANN RESCUES FIDO</h2>


<p>It was almost midnight and the dolls were asleep in their beds; all
except Raggedy Ann.</p>

<p>Raggedy lay there, her shoe-button eyes staring straight up at the
ceiling. Every once in a while Raggedy Ann ran her rag hand up through
her yarn hair. She was thinking.</p>

<p>When she had thought for a long, long time, Raggedy Ann raised herself
on her wabbly elbows and said, "I've thought it all out."</p>

<p>At this the other dolls shook each other and raised up saying, "Listen!
Raggedy has thought it all out!"</p>

<p>"Tell us what you have been thinking, dear Raggedy," said the tin
soldier. "We hope they were pleasant thoughts."</p>

<p>"Not very pleasant thoughts!" said Raggedy, as she brushed a tear from
her shoe-button eyes. "You haven't seen Fido all day, have you?"</p>

<p>"Not since early this morning," the French dolly said.</p>

<p>"It has troubled me," said Raggedy, "and if my head was not stuffed with
lovely new white cotton, I am sure it would have ached with the worry!
When Mistress took me into the living-room this afternoon she was
crying, and I heard her mamma say, 'We will find him! He is sure to come
home soon!' and I knew they were talking of Fido! He must be lost!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>The tin soldier jumped out of bed and ran over to Fido's basket, his tin
feet clicking on the floor as he went. "He is not here," he said.</p>

<p>"When I was sitting in the window about noon-time," said the Indian
doll, "I saw Fido and a yellow scraggly dog playing out on the lawn and
they ran out through a hole in the fence!"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 254px;">
<img src="images/s5b.jpg" width="254" height="400" alt="Dolls leaving through the window" title="Dolls leaving through the window" />
</div>
<p>"That was Priscilla's dog, Peterkins!" said the French doll.</p>

<p>"I know poor Mistress is very sad on account of Fido," said the Dutch
doll, "because I was in the dining-room at supper-time and I heard her
daddy tell her to eat her supper and he would go out and find Fido; but
I had forgotten all about it until now."</p>

<p>"That is the trouble with all of us except Raggedy Ann!" cried the
little penny doll, in a squeaky voice, "She has to think for all of us!"</p>

<p>"I think it would be a good plan for us to show our love for Mistress
and try and find Fido!" exclaimed Raggedy.</p>


<p>"It is a good plan, Raggedy Ann!" cried all the dolls. "Tell us how to
start about it."</p>

<p>"Well, first let us go out upon the lawn and see if we can track the
dogs!" said Raggedy.</p>

<p>"I can track them easily!" the Indian doll said, "for Indians are good
at trailing things!"</p>

<p>"Then let us waste no more time in talking!" said Raggedy Ann, as she
jumped from bed, followed by the rest.</p>

<p>The nursery window was open, so the dolls helped each other up on the
sill and then jumped to the soft grass below. They fell in all sorts of
queer attitudes, but of course the fall did not hurt them.</p>

<p>At the hole in the fence the Indian doll picked up the trail of the two
dogs, and the dolls, stringing out behind, followed him until they came
to Peterkins' house. Peterkins was surprised to see the strange little
figures in white nighties come stringing up the path to the dog house.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/s5c.jpg" width="400" height="240" alt="In the doghouse" title="In the doghouse" />
</div>

<p>Peterkins was too large to sleep in the nursery, so he had a nice cozy
dog-house under the grape arbor.</p>

<p>"Come in," Peterkins said when he saw and recognized the dolls, so all
the dollies went into Peterkins' house and sat about while Raggedy told
him why they had come.</p>

<p>"It has worried me, too!" said Peterkins, "but I had no way of telling
your mistress where Fido was, for she cannot understand dog language!
For you see," Peterkins continued, "Fido and I were having the grandest
romp over in the park when a great big man with a funny thing on the end
of a stick came running towards us. We barked at him and Fido thought he
was trying to play with us and went up too close and do you know, that
wicked man caught Fido in the thing at the end of the stick and carried
him to a wagon and dumped him in with a lot of other dogs!"</p>

<p>"<i>The Dog Catcher!</i>" cried Raggedy Ann.</p>

<p>"Yes!" said Peterkins, as he wiped his eyes with his paws. "It was the
dog catcher! For I followed the wagon at a distance and I saw him put
all the dogs into a big wire pen, so that none could get out!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then you know the way there, Peterkins?" asked Raggedy Ann.</p>

<p>"Yes, I can find it easily," Peterkins said.</p>

<p>"Then show us the way!" Raggedy Ann cried, "for we must try to rescue
Fido."</p>

<p>So Peterkins led the way up alleys and across streets, the dolls all
pattering along behind him. It was a strange procession. Once a strange
dog ran out at them, but Peterkins told him to mind his own business and
the strange dog returned to his own yard.</p>

<p>At last they came to the dog catcher's place. Some of the dogs in the
pen were barking at the moon and others were whining and crying.</p>


<p>There was Fido, all covered with mud, and his pretty red ribbon dragging
on the ground. My, but he was glad to see the dolls and Peterkins! All
the dogs came to the side of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>pen and twisted their heads from side
to side, gazing in wonder at the queer figures of the dolls.</p>

<p>"We will try and let you out," said Raggedy Ann.</p>

<p>At this all the dogs barked joyfully.</p>

<p>Then Raggedy Ann, the other dolls and Peterkins went to the gate.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/s5d.jpg" width="400" height="314" alt="Rescuing Fido" title="Rescuing Fido" />
</div>

<p>The catch was too high for Raggedy Ann to reach, but Peterkins held
Raggedy Ann in his mouth and stood up on his hind legs so that she could
raise the catch.</p>

<p>When the catch was raised, the dogs were so anxious to get out they
pushed and jumped against the gate so hard it flew open, knocking
Peterkins and Raggedy Ann into the mud. Such a yapping and barking was
never heard in the neighborhood as when the dogs swarmed out of the
enclosure, jumping over one another and scrambling about in the mad rush
out the gate.</p>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 254px;">
<img src="images/s5e.jpg" width="254" height="400" alt="Back in through the window" title="Back in through the window" />
</div>
<p>Fido picked himself up from where he had been rolled by the large dogs
and helped Raggedy Ann to her feet. He, Peterkins, and all the dolls ran
after the pack of dogs, turning the corner just as the dog catcher came
running out of the house in his nightgown to see what was causing the
trouble.</p>

<p>He stopped in astonishment when he saw the string of dolls in white
nighties pattering down the alley, for he could not imagine what they
were.</p>


<p>Well, you may be sure the dolls thanked Peterkins for his kind
assistance and they and Fido ran on home, for a faint light was
beginning to show in the east where the sun was getting ready to come
up.</p>

<p>When they got to their own home they found an old chair out in the yard
and after a great deal of work they finally dragged it to the window and
thus managed to get into the nursery again.</p>

<p>Fido was very grateful to Raggedy Ann and the other dolls and before he
went to his basket he gave them each a lick on the cheek.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>The dolls lost no time in scrambling into bed and pulling up the covers,
for they were very sleepy, but just as they were dozing off, Raggedy Ann
raised herself and said, "If my legs and arms were not stuffed with nice
clean cotton I feel sure they would ache, but being stuffed with nice
clean white cotton, they do not ache and I could not feel happier if my
body were stuffed with sunshine, for I know how pleased and happy
Mistress will be in the morning when she discovers Fido asleep in his
own little basket, safe and sound at home."</p>

<p>And as the dollies by this time were all asleep, Raggedy Ann pulled the
sheet up to her chin and smiled so hard she ripped two stitches out of
the back of her rag head.</p>

<p>When housecleaning time came around, Mistress' mamma decided that she
would have the nursery repainted and new paper put upon the walls. That
was why all the dolls happened to be laid helter-skelter upon one of the
high shelves.</p>

<p>Mistress had been in to look at them and wished to put them to bed, but
as the painters were coming again in the early morning, Mamma thought it
best that their beds be piled in the closet.</p>

<p>So the dolls' beds were piled into the closet, one on top of another and
the dolls were placed upon the high shelf.</p>

<p>When all was quiet that night, Raggedy Ann who was on the bottom of the
pile of dolls spoke softly and asked the others if they would mind
moving along the shelf.</p>

<p>"The cotton in my body is getting mashed as flat as a pancake!" said
Raggedy Ann. And although the tin soldier was piled so that his foot was
pressed into Raggedy's face, she still wore her customary smile.</p>

<p>So the dolls began moving off to one side until Raggedy Ann was free to
sit up.</p>

<p>"Ah, that's a great deal better!" she said, stretching her arms and legs
to get the kinks out of them, and patting her dress into shape.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I'll be glad when morning comes!" she said finally, "for I know
Mistress will take us out in the yard and play with us under the trees."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 254px;">
<img src="images/s6b.jpg" width="254" height="400" alt="Tossed in the air" title="Tossed in the air" />
</div><p>So the dolls sat and talked until daylight, when the painters came to
work.</p>

<p>One of the painters, a young fellow, seeing the dolls, reached up and
took Raggedy Ann down from the shelf.</p>

<p>"Look at this rag doll, Jim," he said to one of the other painters,
"She's a daisy," and he took Raggedy Ann by the hands and danced with
her while he whistled a lively tune. Raggedy Ann's heels hit the floor
thumpity-thump and she enjoyed it immensely.</p>

<p>The other dolls sat upon the shelf and looked straight before them, for
it would never do to let grown-up men know that dolls were really alive.</p>

<p>"Better put her back upon the shelf," said one of the other men. "You'll
have the little girl after you! The chances are that she likes that old
rag doll better than any of the others!"</p>

<p>But the young painter twisted Raggedy Ann into funny attitudes and
laughed and laughed as she looped about. Finally he got to tossing her
up in the air and catching her. This was great fun for Raggedy and as
she sailed up by the shelf the dolls all smiled at her, for it pleased
them whenever Raggedy Ann was happy.</p>

<p>But the young fellow threw Raggedy Ann up into the air once too often
and when she came down he failed to catch her and she came down
<i>splash</i>, head first into a bucket of oily paint.</p>

<p>"I told you!" said the older painter, "and now you are in for it!"</p>

<p>"My goodness! I didn't mean to do it!" said the young fellow, "What had
I better do with her?"</p>

<p>"Better put her back on the shelf!" replied the other.</p>

<p>So Raggedy was placed back upon the shelf and the paint ran from her
head and trickled down upon her dress.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/s6c.jpg" width="400" height="246" alt="Covered with paint" title="Covered with paint" />
</div>

<p>After breakfast, Mistress came into the nursery and saw Raggedy all
covered with paint and she began crying.</p>

<p>The young painter felt sorry and told her how it had happened.</p>

<p>"If you will let me," he said, "I will take her home with me and will
clean her up tonight and will bring her back day after tomorrow."</p>

<p>So Raggedy was wrapped in a newspaper that evening and carried away.</p>

<p>All the dolls felt sad that night without Raggedy Ann near them.</p>

<p>"Poor Raggedy! I could have cried when I saw her all covered with
paint!" said the French doll.</p>

<p>"She didn't look like our dear old Raggedy Ann at all!" said the tin
soldier, who wiped the tears from his eyes so that they would not run
down on his arms and rust them.</p>

<p>"The paint covered her lovely smile and nose and you could not see the
laughter in her shoe-button eyes!" said the Indian doll.</p>

<p>And so the dolls talked that night and the next. But in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>the daytime
when the painters were there, they kept very quiet.</p>

<p>The second day Raggedy was brought home and the dolls were all anxious
for night to come so that they could see and talk with Raggedy Ann.</p>

<p>At last the painters left and the house was quiet, for Mistress had been
in and placed Raggedy on the shelf with the other dolls.</p>

<p>"Tell us all about it, Raggedy dear!" the dolls cried.</p>

<p>"Oh I am so glad I fell in the paint!" cried Raggedy, after she had
hugged all the dolls, "For I have had the happiest time. The painter
took me home and told his Mamma how I happened to be covered with paint
and she was very sorry. She took a rag and wiped off my shoe-button eyes
and then I saw that she was a very pretty, sweet-faced lady and she got
some cleaner and wiped off most of the paint on my face.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>"But you know," Raggedy continued, "the paint had soaked through my rag
head and had made the cotton inside all sticky and soggy and I could not
think clearly. And my yarn hair was all matted with paint.</p>

<p>"So the kind lady took off my yarn hair and cut the stitches out of my
head, and took out all the painty cotton.</p>

<p>"It was a great relief, although it felt queer at first and my thoughts
seemed scattered.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 251px;">
<img src="images/s6e.jpg" width="251" height="400" alt="On the line again" title="On the line again" />
</div>
<p>"She left me in her work-basket that night and hung me out upon the
clothes-line the next morning when she had washed the last of the paint
off.</p>

<p>"And while I hung out on the clothes-line, what do you think?"</p>

<p>"We could never guess!" all the dolls cried.</p>

<p>"Why a dear little Jenny Wren came and picked enough cotton out of me to
make a cute little cuddly nest in the grape arbor!"</p>

<p>"Wasn't that sweet!" cried all the dolls.</p>

<p>"Yes indeed it was!" replied Raggedy Ann, "It made me very happy. Then
when the lady took me in the house again she stuffed me with lovely nice
new cotton, all the way from my knees up and sewed me up and put new
yarn on my head for hair and&mdash;and&mdash;and it's a secret!" said Raggedy Ann.</p>

<p>"Oh tell us the secret!" cried all the dolls, as they pressed closer to
Raggedy. "Well, I know you will not tell anyone who would not be glad to
know about it, so I will tell you the secret and why I am wearing my
smile a trifle broader!" said Raggedy Ann.</p>

<p>The dolls all said that Raggedy Ann's smile was indeed a quarter of an
inch wider on each side.</p>



<p>"When the dear lady put the new white cotton in my body," said Raggedy
Ann "she went to the cupboard and came back with a paper bag. And she
took from the bag ten or fifteen little candy hearts with mottos on them
and she hunted through the candy hearts until she found a beautiful
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>red one which she sewed up in me with the cotton! So that is the
secret, and that is why I am so happy! Feel here," said Raggedy Ann. All
the dolls could feel Raggedy Ann's beautiful new candy heart and they
were very happy for her.</p>

<p>After all had hugged each other good night and had cuddled up for the
night, the tin soldier asked, "Did you have a chance to see what the
motto on your new candy heart was, Raggedy Ann?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes," replied Raggedy Ann, "I was so happy I forgot to tell you. It
had printed upon it in nice blue letters, 'I LOVE YOU.'"</p>

<h2><a name="RAGGEDY_ANNS_TRIP_ON_THE_RIVER" id="RAGGEDY_ANNS_TRIP_ON_THE_RIVER"></a>RAGGEDY ANN'S TRIP ON THE RIVER</h2>


<p>When Marcella had a tea party out in the orchard, of course all of the
dolls were invited. Raggedy Ann, the tin soldier, the Indian doll and
all the others&mdash;even the four little penny dolls in the spool box. After
a lovely tea party with ginger cookies and milk, of course the dolls
were very sleepy, at least Marcella thought so, so she took all except
Raggedy Ann into the house and put them to bed for the afternoon nap.
Then Marcella told Raggedy Ann to stay there and watch the things.</p>

<p>As there was nothing else to do, Raggedy Ann waited for Marcella to
return. And as she watched the little ants eating cookie crumbs Marcella
had thrown to them, she heard all of a sudden the patter of puppy feet
behind her. It was Fido.</p>

<p>The puppy dog ran up to Raggedy Ann and twisted his head about as he
looked at her. Then he put his front feet out and barked in Raggedy
Ann's face. Raggedy Ann tried to look very stern, but she could not hide
the broad smile painted on her face.</p>

<p>"Oh, you want to play, do you?" the puppy dog barked, as he jumped at
Raggedy Ann and then jumped back again.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 253px;">
<img src="images/s7b.jpg" width="253" height="400" alt="Into the river" title="Into the river" />
</div>
<p>The more Raggedy Ann smiled, the livelier Fido's antics <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>became, until
finally he caught the end of her dress and dragged her about.</p>

<p>This was great fun for the puppy dog, but Raggedy Ann did not enjoy it.
She kicked and twisted as much as she could, but the puppy dog thought
Raggedy was playing.</p>

<p>He ran out the garden gate and down the path across the meadow, every
once in a while stopping and pretending he was very angry. When he
pretended this, Fido would give Raggedy Ann a great shaking, making her
yarn head hit the ground "ratty-tat-tat." Then he would give his head a
toss and send Raggedy Ann high in the air where she would turn over two
or three times before she reached the ground.</p>

<p>By this time, she had lost her apron and now some of her yarn hair was
coming loose.</p>

<p>As Fido neared the brook, another puppy dog came running across the
foot-bridge to meet him. "What have you there, Fido?" said the new puppy
dog as he bounced up to Raggedy Ann.</p>

<p>"This is Raggedy Ann," answered Fido. "She and I are having a lovely
time playing."</p>

<p>You see, Fido really thought Raggedy enjoyed being tossed around and
whirled high up in the air. But of course she didn't. However, the game
didn't last much longer. As Raggedy Ann hit the ground the new puppy dog
caught her dress and ran with her across the bridge, Fido barking close
behind him.</p>

<p>In the center of the bridge, Fido caught up with the new puppy dog and
they had a lively tug-of-war with Raggedy Ann stretched between then. As
they pulled and tugged and flopped Raggedy Ann about, somehow she fell
over the side of the bridge into the water.</p>

<p>The puppy dogs were surprised, and Fido was very sorry indeed, for he
remembered how good Raggedy Ann had been to him and how she had rescued
him from the dog-pound. But the current carried Raggedy Ann right along
and all Fido could do was to run along the bank and bark.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/s7c.jpg" width="400" height="240" alt="Floating" title="Floating" />
</div>

<p>Now, you would have thought Raggedy Ann would sink, but no, she floated
nicely, for she was stuffed with clean white cotton and the water didn't
soak through very quickly.</p>

<p>After a while, the strange puppy and Fido grew tired of running along
the bank and the strange puppy scampered home over the meadow, with his
tail carried gaily over his back as if he had nothing to be ashamed of.
But Fido walked home very sorry indeed. His little heart was broken to
think that he had caused Raggedy Ann to be drowned.</p>

<p>But Raggedy Ann didn't drown&mdash;not a bit of it. In fact, she even went to
sleep on the brook, for the motion of the current was very soothing as
it carried her along&mdash;just like being rocked by Marcella.</p>

<p>So, sleeping peacefully, Raggedy Ann drifted along with the current
until she came to a pool where she lodged against a large stone.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/s7d.jpg" width="400" height="309" alt="On a stone" title="On a stone" />
</div>
<p>Raggedy Ann tried to climb upon the stone, but by this time the water
had thoroughly soaked through Raggedy Ann's nice, clean, white cotton
stuffing and she was so heavy she could not climb.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>So there she had to stay until Marcella and Daddy came along and found
her.</p>

<p>You see, they had been looking for her. They had found pieces of her
apron all along the path and across the meadow where Fido and the
strange puppy dog had shaken them from Raggedy Ann. So they followed the
brook until they found her.</p>

<p>When Daddy fished Raggedy Ann from the water, Marcella hugged her so
tightly to her breast the water ran from Raggedy Ann and dripped all
over Marcella's apron. But Marcella was so glad to find Raggedy Ann
again she didn't mind it a bit. She just hurried home and took off all
of Raggedy Ann's wet clothes and placed her on a little red chair in
front of the oven door, and then brought all of the other dolls in and
read a fairy tale to them while Raggedy Ann steamed and dried.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>When Raggedy Ann was thoroughly dry, Mamma said she thought the cake
must be finished and she took from the oven a lovely chocolate cake and
gave Marcella a large piece to have another tea party with.</p>

<p>That night when all the house was asleep, Raggedy Ann raised up in bed
and said to the dolls who were still awake, "I am so happy I do not feel
a bit sleepy. Do you know, I believe the water soaked me so thoroughly
my candy heart must have melted and filled my whole body, and I do not
feel the least bit angry with Fido for playing with me so roughly!"</p>

<p>So all the other dolls were happy, too, for happiness is very easy to
catch when we love one another and are sweet all through.</p>

<p>Raggedy Ann lay just as Marcella had dropped her&mdash;all sprawled out with
her rag arms and legs twisted in ungraceful attitudes.</p>

<p>Her yarn hair was twisted and lay partly over her face, hiding one of
her shoe-button eyes.</p>

<p>Raggedy gave no sign that she had heard, but lay there smiling at the
ceiling.</p>

<p>Perhaps Raggedy Ann knew that what the new dolls said was true.</p>

<p>But sometimes the truth may hurt and this may have been the reason
Raggedy Ann lay there so still.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see such an ungainly creature!"</p>

<p>"I do believe it has shoe buttons for eyes!"</p>

<p>"And yarn hair!"</p>

<p>"Mercy, did you ever see such feet!"</p>

<p>The Dutch doll rolled off the doll sofa and said "Mamma" in his quavery
voice, he was so surprised at hearing anyone speak so of beloved Raggedy
Ann&mdash;dear Raggedy Ann, she of the candy heart, whom all the dolls loved.</p>

<p>Uncle Clem was also very much surprised and offended. He walked up in
front of the two new dolls and looked them sternly in the eyes, but he
could think of nothing to say so he pulled at his yarn mustache.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 257px;">
<img src="images/s8b.jpg" width="257" height="400" alt="Annabel-Lee and Thomas" title="Annabel-Lee and Thomas" />
</div>
<p>Marcella had only received the two new dolls that morning. They had come
in the morning mail and were presents from an aunt.</p>

<p>Marcella had named the two new dolls Annabel-Lee and Thomas, after her
aunt and uncle.</p>

<p>Annabel-Lee and Thomas were beautiful dolls and must have cost heaps and
heaps of shiny pennies, for both were handsomely dressed and had <i>real</i>
hair!</p>

<p>Annabel's hair was of a lovely shade of auburn and Thomas' was golden
yellow.</p>

<p>Annabel was dressed in soft, lace-covered silk and upon her head she
wore a beautiful hat with long silk ribbons tied in a neat bow-knot
beneath her dimpled chin.</p>

<p>Thomas was dressed in an Oliver Twist suit of dark velvet with a lace
collar. Both he and Annabel wore lovely black slippers and short
stockings.</p>

<p>They were sitting upon two of the little red doll chairs where Marcella
had placed them and where they could see the other dolls.</p>

<p>When Uncle Clem walked in front of them and pulled his mustache they
laughed outright. "Tee-Hee-Hee!" they snickered, "He has holes in his
knees!"</p>

<p>Quite true. Uncle Clem was made of worsted and the moths had eaten his
knees and part of his kiltie. He had a kiltie, you see, for Uncle Clem
was a Scotch doll.</p>

<p>Uncle Clem shook, but he felt so hurt he could think of nothing to say.</p>

<p>He walked over and sat down beside Raggedy Ann and brushed her yarn hair
away from her shoe-button eye.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/s8c.jpg" width="400" height="241" alt="Hurt feelings" title="Hurt feelings" />
</div>

<p>The tin soldier went over and sat beside them.</p>

<p>"Don't you mind what they say, Raggedy!" he said, "They do not know you
as we do!"</p>

<p>"We don't care to know her!" said Annabel-Lee as she primped her dress,
"She looks like a scarecrow!"</p>

<p>"And the Soldier must have been made with a can opener!" laughed
Thomas.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>


<p>"You should be ashamed of yourselves!" said the French dolly, as she
stood before Annabel and Thomas, "You will make all of us sorry that you
have joined our family if you continue to poke fun at us and look down
upon us. We are all happy here together and share in each others'
adventures and happiness."</p>

<p>Now, that night Marcella did not undress the two new dolls, for she had
no nighties for them, so she let them sit up in the two little red doll
chairs so they would not muss their clothes. "I will make nighties for
you tomorrow!" she said as she kissed them good night. Then she went
over and gave Raggedy Ann a good night hug. "Take good care of all my
children, Raggedy!" she said as she went out.</p>

<p>Annabel and Thomas whispered together, "Perhaps we have been too hasty
in our judgment!" said Annabel-Lee. "This Raggedy Ann seems to be a
favorite with the mistress and with all the dolls!"</p>

<p>"There must be a reason!" replied Thomas, "I am beginning to feel sorry
that we spoke of her looks. One really cannot help one's looks after
all."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, Annabel-Lee and Thomas were very tired after their long journey and
soon they fell asleep and forgot all about the other dolls.</p>

<p>When they were sound asleep, Raggedy Ann slipped quietly from her bed
and awakened the tin soldier and Uncle Clem and the three tiptoed to the
two beautiful new dolls.</p>

<p>They lifted them gently so as not to awaken them and carried them to
Raggedy Ann's bed.</p>

<p>Raggedy Ann tucked them in snugly and lay down upon the hard floor.</p>

<p>The tin soldier and Uncle Clem both tried to coax Raggedy Ann into
accepting their bed (they slept together), but Raggedy Ann would not
hear of it.</p>

<p>"I am stuffed with nice soft cotton and the hard floor does not bother
me at all!" said Raggedy.</p>

<p>At daybreak the next morning Annabel and Thomas awak<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>ened to find
themselves in Raggedy Ann's bed and as they raised up and looked at each
other each knew how ashamed the other felt, for they knew Raggedy Ann
had generously given them her bed.</p>

<p>There Raggedy Ann lay; all sprawled out upon the hard floor, her rag
arms and legs twisted in ungraceful attitudes.</p>

<p>"How good and honest she looks!" said Annabel. "It must be her
shoe-button eyes!"</p>

</div>
<p>"How nicely her yarn hair falls in loops over her face!" exclaimed
Thomas, "I did not notice how pleasant her face looked last night!"</p>

<p>"The others seem to love her ever and ever so much!" mused Annabel. "It
must be because she is so kind."</p>

<p>Both new dolls were silent for a while, thinking deeply.</p>

<p>"How do you feel?" Thomas finally asked.</p>

<p>"Very much ashamed of myself!" answered Annabel, "And you, Thomas?"</p>

<p>"As soon as Raggedy Ann awakens, I shall tell her just how much ashamed
I am of myself and if she can, I want her to forgive me!" Thomas said.</p>

<p>"The more I look at her, the better I like her!" said Annabel.</p>

<p>"I am going to kiss her!" said Thomas.</p>

<p>"You'll awaken her if you do!" said Annabel.</p>

<p>But Thomas climbed out of bed and kissed Raggedy Ann on her painted
cheek and smoothed her yarn hair from her rag forehead.</p>

<p>And Annabel-Lee climbed out of bed, too, and kissed Raggedy Ann.</p>

<p>Then Thomas and Annabel-Lee gently carried Raggedy Ann and put her in
her own bed and tenderly tucked her in, and then took their seats in the
two little red chairs.</p>

<p>After a while Annabel said softly to Thomas, "I feel ever and ever so
much better and happier!"</p>



<p>"So do I!" Thomas replied. "It's like a whole lot of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>sunshine coming
into a dark room, and I shall always try to keep it there!"</p>

<p>Fido had one fuzzy white ear sticking up over the edge of his basket and
he gave his tail a few thumps against his pillow.</p>

<p>Raggedy Ann lay quietly in bed where Thomas and Annabel had tucked her.
And as she smiled at the ceiling, her candy heart (with "I LOVE YOU"
written on it) thrilled with contentment, for, as you have probably
guessed, Raggedy Ann had not been asleep at all!</p>

<p>Marcella had come early in the morning and dressed all the dolls and
placed them about the nursery.</p>

<p>Some of the dolls had been put in the little red chairs around the
little doll table. There was nothing to eat upon the table except a
turkey, a fried egg and an apple, all made of plaster of paris and
painted in natural colors. The little teapot and other doll dishes were
empty, but Marcella had told them to enjoy their dinner while she was
away.</p>

<p>The French dolly had been given a seat upon the doll sofa and Uncle Clem
had been placed at the piano.</p>

<p>Marcella picked up Raggedy Ann and carried her out of the nursery when
she left, telling the dolls to "be real good children, while Mamma is
away!"</p>

<p>When the door closed, the tin soldier winked at the Dutch-boy doll and
handed the imitation turkey to the penny dolls. "Have some nice turkey?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"No thank you!" the penny dolls said in little penny-doll, squeaky
voices, "We have had all we can eat!"</p>

<p>"Shall I play you a tune?" asked Uncle Clem of the French doll.</p>

<p>At this all the dolls laughed, for Uncle Clem could not begin to play
any tune. Raggedy Ann was the only doll who <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>had ever taken lessons, and
she could play Peter-Peter-Pumpkin-Eater with one hand.</p>

<p>In fact, Marcella had almost worn out Raggedy Ann's right hand teaching
it to her.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 256px;">
<img src="images/s9b.jpg" width="256" height="400" alt="Fido has a secret" title="Fido has a secret" />
</div>

<p>"Play something lively!" said the French doll, as she giggled behind her
hand, so Uncle Clem began hammering the eight keys on the toy piano with
all his might until a noise was heard upon the stairs.</p>

<p>Quick as a wink, all the dolls took the same positions in which they had
been placed by Marcella, for they did not wish really truly people to
know that they could move about.</p>

<p>But it was only Fido. He put his nose in the door and looked around.</p>

<p>All the dolls at the table looked steadily at the painted food, and
Uncle Clem leaned upon the piano keys looking just as unconcerned as
when he had been placed there.</p>

<p>Then Fido pushed the door open and came into the nursery wagging his
tail.</p>

<p>He walked over to the table and sniffed, in hopes Marcella had given the
dolls real food and that some would still be left.</p>

<p>"Where's Raggedy Ann?" Fido asked, when he had satisfied himself that
there was no food.</p>

<p>"Mistress took Raggedy Ann and went somewhere!" all the dolls answered
in chorus.</p>

<p>"I've found something I must tell Raggedy Ann about!" said Fido, as he
scratched his ear.</p>

<p>"Is it a secret?" asked the penny dolls.</p>

<p>"Secret nothing," replied Fido, "It's kittens!"</p>

<p>"How lovely!" cried all the dolls, "Really live kittens?"</p>

<p>"Really live kittens!" replied Fido, "Three little tiny ones, out in the
barn!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I wish Raggedy Ann was here!" cried the French doll. "She would
know what to do about it!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/s9d.jpg" width="400" height="236" alt="Fido runs to tell news" title="Fido runs to tell news" />
</div>



<p>"That's why I wanted to see her," said Fido, as he thumped his tail on
the floor, "I did not know there were any <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>kittens and I went into the
barn to hunt for mice and the first thing I knew Mamma Cat came bouncing
right at me with her eyes looking green! I tell you I hurried out of
there!"</p>



<p>"How did you know there were any kittens then?" asked Uncle Clem.</p>

<p>"I waited around the barn until Mamma Cat went up to the house and then
I slipped into the barn again, for I knew there must be something inside
or she would not have jumped at me that way! We are always very
friendly, you know." Fido continued. "And what was my surprise to find
three tiny little kittens in an old basket, 'way back in a dark corner!"</p>

<p>"Go get them, Fido, and bring them up so we can see them!" said the tin
soldier.</p>

<p>"Not me!" said Fido, "If I had a suit of tin clothes on like you have I
might do it, but you know cats can scratch very hard if they want to!"</p>

<p>"We will tell Raggedy when she comes in!" said the French doll, and then
Fido went out to play with a neighbor dog.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>So when Raggedy Ann had been returned to the nursery the dolls could
hardly wait until Marcella had put on their nighties and left them for
the night.</p>

<p>Then they told Raggedy Ann all about the kittens.</p>

<p>Raggedy Ann jumped from her bed and ran over to Fido's basket; he wasn't
there.</p>

<p>Then Raggedy suggested that all the dolls go out to the barn and see the
kittens. This they did easily, for the window was open and it was but a
short jump to the ground.</p>

<p>They found Fido out near the barn watching a hole.</p>

<p>"I was afraid something might disturb them," he said, "for Mamma Cat
went away about an hour ago."</p>

<p>All the dolls, with Raggedy Ann in the lead, crawled through the hole
and ran to the basket.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/s9e.jpg" width="400" height="303" alt="Waiting to see" title="Waiting to see" />
</div>

<p>Just as Raggedy Ann started to pick up one of the kittens <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>there was a
lot of howling and yelping and Fido came bounding through the hole with
Mamma Cat behind him. When Mamma Cat caught up with Fido he would yelp.</p>

<p>When Fido and Mamma Cat had circled the barn two or three times Fido
managed to find the hole and escape to the yard; then Mamma Cat came
over to the basket and saw all the dolls.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 256px;">
<img src="images/s9f.jpg" width="256" height="400" alt="Raggedy Ann and a kitten" title="Raggedy Ann and a kitten" />
</div>
<p>"I'm s'prised at you, Mamma Cat!" said Raggedy Ann, "Fido has been
watching your kittens for an hour while you were away. He wouldn't hurt
them for anything!"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, then," said Mamma Cat.</p>

<p>"You must trust Fido, Mamma Cat!" said Raggedy Ann, "because he loves
you and anyone who loves you can be trusted!"</p>

<p>"That's so!" replied Mamma Cat. "Cats love mice, too, and I wish the
mice trusted us more!"</p>

<p>The dolls all laughed at this joke.</p>

<p>"Have you told the folks up at the house about your dear little
kittens?" Raggedy Ann asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, my, no!" exclaimed Mamma Cat. "At the last place I lived the people
found out about my kittens and do you know, all the kittens disappeared!
I intend keeping this a secret!"</p>

<p>"But all the folks at this house are very kindly people and would dearly
love your kittens!" cried all the dolls.</p>

<p>"Let's take them right up to the nursery!" said Raggedy Ann, "And
Mistress can find them there in the morning!"</p>

<p>"How lovely!" said all the dolls in chorus. "Do, Mamma Cat! Raggedy Ann
knows, for she is stuffed with nice clean white cotton and is very
wise!"</p>

<p>So after a great deal of persuasion, Mamma Cat finally consented.
Raggedy Ann took two of the kittens and carried them to the house while
Mamma Cat carried the other.</p>

<p>Raggedy Ann wanted to give the kittens her bed, but Fido, who was
anxious to prove his affection, insisted that Mamma Cat and the kittens
should have his nice soft basket.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>The dolls could hardly sleep that night; they were so anxious to see
what Mistress would say when she found the dear little kittens in the
morning.</p>

<p>Raggedy Ann did not sleep a wink, for she shared her bed with Fido and
he kept her awake whispering to her.</p>

<p>In the morning when Marcella came to the nursery, the first thing she
saw was the three little kittens.</p>

<p>She cried out in delight and carried them all down to show to Mamma and
Daddy. Mamma Cat went trailing along, arching her back and purring with
pride as she rubbed against all the chairs and doors.</p>

<p>Mamma and Daddy said the kittens could stay in the nursery and belong to
Marcella, so Marcella took them back to Fido's basket while she hunted
names for them out of a fairy tale book.</p>

<p>Marcella finally decided upon three names; Prince Charming for the white
kitty, Cinderella for the Maltese and Princess Golden for the kitty with
the yellow stripes.</p>

<p>So that is how the three little kittens came to live in the nursery.</p>

<p>And it all turned out just as Raggedy Ann had said, for her head was
stuffed with clean white cotton, and she could think exceedingly wise
thoughts.</p>

<p>And Mamma Cat found out that Fido was a very good friend, too. She grew
to trust him so much she would even let him help wash the kittens'
faces.</p>

<p>All the dolls were tucked snugly in their little doll-beds for the night
and the large house was very still.</p>

<p>Every once in a while Fido would raise one ear and partly open one eye,
for his keen dog sense seemed to tell him that something was about to
happen.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 257px;">
<img src="images/s10b.jpg" width="257" height="400" alt="Fido wakes Raggedy Ann" title="Fido wakes Raggedy Ann" />
</div>
<p>Finally he opened both eyes, sniffed into the air and, getting out of
his basket and shaking himself, he trotted across the nursery to Raggedy
Ann's bed.</p>

<p>Fido put his cold nose in Raggedy Ann's neck. She raised her head from
the little pillow.</p>

<p>"Oh! It's you, Fido!" said Raggedy Ann. "I dreamed the tin soldier put
an icicle down my neck!"</p>

<p>"I can't sleep," Fido told Raggedy Ann. "I feel that something is about
to happen!"</p>

<p>"You have been eating too many bones lately, Fido, and they keep you
awake," Raggedy replied.</p>

<p>"No, it isn't that. I haven't had any bones since the folks had beef
last Sunday. It isn't that. Listen, Raggedy!"</p>

<p>Raggedy Ann listened.</p>

<p>There was a murmur as if someone were singing, far away.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Fido.</p>

<p>"Sh!" cautioned Raggedy Ann, "It's music."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>It was indeed music, the most beautiful music Raggedy Ann had ever
heard.</p>

<p>It grew louder, but still seemed to be <i>far</i> away.</p>

<p>Raggedy Ann and Fido could hear it distinctly and it sounded as if
hundreds of voices were singing in unison.</p>

<p>"Please don't howl, Fido," Raggedy Ann said as she put her two rag arms
around the dog's nose. Fido usually "sang" when he heard music.</p>

<p>But Fido did not sing this time; he was filled with wonder. It seemed as
if something very nice was going to happen.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/s10c.jpg" width="400" height="244" alt="Fairies singing" title="Fairies singing" />
</div>
<p>Raggedy Ann sat upright in bed. The room was flooded with a strange,
beautiful light and the music came floating in through the nursery
window.</p>

<p>Raggedy Ann hopped from her bed and ran across the floor, trailing the
bed clothes behind her. Fido followed close behind and together they
looked out the window across the flower garden.</p>

<p>There among the flowers were hundreds of tiny beings, some playing on
tiny reed instruments and flower horns, while others sang. This was the
strange, wonderful music Raggedy and Fido had heard.</p>

<p>"It's the Fairies!" said Raggedy Ann. "To your basket quick, Fido! They
are coming this way!" And Raggedy Ann ran back to her bed, with the bed
clothes trailing behind her.</p>

<p>Fido gave three jumps and he was in his basket, pretending he was sound
asleep, but one little black eye was peeping through a chink in the
side.</p>

<p>Raggedy jumped into her bed and pulled the covers to her chin, but lay
so that her shoe-button eyes could see towards the window.</p>



<p>Little Fairy forms radiant as silver came flitting into the nursery,
singing in far away voices. They carried a little bundle. A beautiful
light came from this bundle, and to Raggedy Ann and Fido it seemed like
sunshine and moon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>shine mixed. It was a soft mellow light, just the
sort of light you would expect to accompany Fairy Folk.</p>



<p>As Raggedy watched, her candy heart went pitty-pat against her cotton
stuffing, for she saw a tiny pink foot sticking out of the bundle of
light.</p>

<p>The Fairy troop sailed across the nursery and through the door with
their bundle and Raggedy Ann and Fido listened to their far away music
as they went down the hall.</p>

<p>Presently the Fairies returned without the bundle and disappeared
through the nursery window.</p>

<p>Raggedy Ann and Fido again ran to the window and saw the Fairy troop
dancing among the flowers.</p>

<p>The light from the bundle still hung about the nursery and a strange
lovely perfume floated about.</p>

<p>When the Fairies' music ceased and they had flown away, Raggedy Ann and
Fido returned to Raggedy's bed to think it all out.</p>

<p>When old Mister Sun peeped over the garden wall and into the nursery,
and the other dolls awakened, Raggedy Ann and Fido were still puzzled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is it, Raggedy Ann?" asked the tin soldier and Uncle Clem, in one
voice.</p>

<p>Before Raggedy Ann could answer, Marcella came running into the nursery,
gathered up all the dolls in her arms, and ran down the hall, Fido
jumping beside her and barking shrilly.</p>

<p>"Be quiet!" Marcella said to Fido, "It's asleep and you might awaken
it!"</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/s10d.jpg" width="400" height="307" alt="The bundle the fairies brought" title="The bundle the fairies brought" />
</div>
<p>Mamma helped Marcella arrange all the dolls in a circle around the bed
so that they could all see what was in the bundle.</p>

<p>Mamma gently pulled back the soft covering and the dolls saw a tiny
little fist as pink as coral, a soft little face with a cunning tiny
pink nose, and a little head as bald as the French dolly's when her hair
came off.</p>

<p>My, how the dollies all chattered when they were once again left alone
in the nursery!</p>



<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>"A dear cuddly baby brother for Mistress!" said Uncle Clem.</p>

<p>"A beautiful bundle of love and Fairy Sunshine for everybody in the
house!" said Raggedy Ann, as she went to the toy piano and joyously
played "Peter-Peter-Pumpkin-Eater" with one rag hand.</p>

<h2><a name="RAGGEDY_ANN_AND_THE_CHICKENS" id="RAGGEDY_ANN_AND_THE_CHICKENS"></a>RAGGEDY ANN AND THE CHICKENS</h2>


<p>When Marcella was called into the house she left Raggedy sitting on the
chicken yard fence. "Now you sit quietly and do not stir," Marcella told
Raggedy Ann, "If you move you may fall and hurt yourself!"</p>

<p>So, Raggedy Ann sat quietly, just as Marcella told her, but she smiled
at the chickens for she had fallen time and again and it had never hurt
her in the least. She was stuffed with nice soft cotton, you see.</p>

<p>So, there she sat until a tiny little humming-bird, in search of flower
honey hummed close to Raggedy Ann's head and hovered near the tall
Hollyhocks.</p>

<p>Raggedy Ann turned her rag head to see the humming-bird and lost her
balance&mdash;<i>plump!</i> she went, down amongst the chickens.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 256px;">
<img src="images/s11b.jpg" width="256" height="400" alt="Raggedy Ann and the rooster" title="Raggedy Ann and the rooster" />
</div>
<p>The chickens scattered in all directions, all except Old Ironsides, the
rooster.</p>

<p>He ruffled his neck feathers and put his head down close to the ground,
making a queer whistling noise as he looked fiercely at Raggedy Ann.</p>

<p>But Raggedy Ann only smiled at Old Ironsides, the rooster, and ran her
rag hand through her yarn hair for she did not fear him.</p>

<p>And then something strange happened, for when she made <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>this motion the
old rooster jumped up in the air and kicked his feet out in front,
knocking Raggedy Ann over and over.</p>

<p>When Raggedy Ann stopped rolling she waved her apron at the rooster and
cried, "Shoo!" but instead of "shooing," Old Ironsides upset her again.</p>

<p>Now, two old hens who had been watching the rooster jump at Raggedy ran
up and as one old hen placed herself before the rooster, the other old
hen caught hold of Raggedy's apron and dragged her into the
chicken-coop.</p>

<p>It was dark inside and Raggedy could not tell what was going on as she
felt herself being pulled up over the nests.</p>

<p>But, finally Raggedy could sit up, for the old hen had quit pulling her,
and as her shoe-button eyes were very good, she soon made out the shape
of the old hen in front of her.</p>

<p>"My! that's the hardest work I have done in a long time!" said the old
hen, when she could catch her breath. "I was afraid Mr. Rooster would
tear your dress and apron!"</p>

<p>"That was a queer game he was playing, Mrs. Hen," said Raggedy Ann.</p>

<p>The old hen chuckled 'way down in her throat, "Gracious me! He wasn't
playing a game, he was fighting you!"</p>

<p>"Fighting!" cried Raggedy Ann in surprise.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, indeed!" the old hen answered, "Old Ironsides, the rooster,
thought you intended to harm some of the children chickens and he was
fighting you!"</p>

<p>"I am sorry that I fell inside the pen, I wouldn't harm anything,"
Raggedy Ann said.</p>

<p>"If we tell you a secret you must promise not to tell your mistress!"
said the old hens.</p>

<p>"I promise! Cross my candy heart!" said Raggedy Ann.</p>

<p>Then the two old hens took Raggedy Ann 'way back in the farthest corner
of the chicken coop. There, in back of a box, they had built two nests
and each old hen had ten eggs in her nest.</p>

<p>"If your folks hear of it they will take the eggs!" said the hens, "and
then we could not raise our families!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/s11c.jpg" width="400" height="240" alt="Raggedy Ann and chickens" title="Raggedy Ann and chickens" />
</div>

<p>Raggedy Ann felt the eggs and they were nice and warm.</p>

<p>"We just left the nests when you fell into the pen!" explained the old
hens.</p>

<p>"But how can the eggs grow if you sit upon them?" said Raggedy. "If Fido
sits on any of the garden, the plants will not grow, Mistress says!"</p>

<p>"Eggs are different!" one old hen explained. "In order to make the eggs
hatch properly, we must sit on them three weeks and not let them get
cold at any time!"</p>

<p>"And at the end of the three weeks do the eggs sprout?" asked Raggedy
Ann.</p>

<p>"You must be thinking of eggplant!" cried one old hen. "These eggs hatch
at the end of three weeks&mdash;they don't sprout&mdash;and then we have a lovely
family of soft downy chickies; little puff balls that we can cuddle
under our wings and love dearly!"</p>

<p>"Have you been sitting upon the eggs very long?" Raggedy asked.</p>

<p>"Neither one of us has kept track of the time," said one hen. "So we do
not know! You see, we never leave the nests only just once in a while to
get a drink and to eat a little.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> So we can hardly tell when it is day
and when it is night."</p>

<p>"We were going out to get a drink when you fell in the pen!" said one
old hen. "Now we will have to sit upon the eggs and warm them up again!"</p>

<p>The two old hens spread their feathers and nestled down upon the nests.</p>

<p>"When you get them good and warm, I would be glad to sit upon the eggs
to keep them warm until you get something to eat and drink!" said
Raggedy. So the two old hens walked out of the coop to finish their meal
which had been interrupted by Raggedy's fall and while they were gone,
Raggedy Ann sat quietly upon the warm eggs. Suddenly down beneath her
she heard something go, "Pick, pick!" "I hope it isn't a mouse!" Raggedy
Ann said to herself, when she felt something move. "I wish the old hens
would come back." But when they came back and saw the puzzled expression
on her face, they cried, "What is it?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/s11e.jpg" width="400" height="311" alt="Raggedy Ann sitting on eggs" title="Raggedy Ann sitting on eggs" />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>Raggedy Ann got to her feet and looked down and there were several
little fluffy, cuddly baby chickies, round as little puff-balls.</p>

<p>"Cheep! Cheep! Cheep!" they cried when Raggedy stepped out of the nest.</p>

<p>"Baby Chicks!" Raggedy cried, as she stooped and picked up one of the
little puff-balls. "They want to be cuddled!"</p>

<p>The two old hens, their eyes shining with happiness, got upon the nests
and spread out their soft warm feathers, "The other eggs will hatch
soon!" said they.</p>

<p>So, for several days Raggedy helped the two hens hatch out the rest of
the chickies and just as they finished, Marcella came inside looking
around.</p>

<p>"How in the world did you get in here, Raggedy Ann?" she cried. "I have
been looking all about for you! Did the chickens drag you in here?"</p>

<p>Both old hens down behind the box clucked softly to the chickies beneath
them and Marcella overheard them.</p>

<p>She lifted the box away and gave a little squeal of surprise and
happiness.</p>

<p>"Oh you dear old Hennypennies!" she cried, lifting both old hens from
their nests. "You have hidden your nests away back here and now you have
one, two, three, four&mdash;twenty chickies!" and as she counted them,
Marcella placed them in her apron; then catching up Raggedy Ann, she
placed her over the new little chickies.</p>

<p>"Come on, old Hennypennies!" she said, and went out of the coop with the
two old hens clucking at her heels.</p>

<p>Marcella called Daddy and Daddy rolled two barrels out under one of the
trees and made a nice bed in each. Then he nailed slats across the
front, leaving a place for a door. Each Hennypennie was then given ten
little chickies and shut up in the barrel. And all the dolls were happy
when they heard of Raggedy's adventure and they did not have to wait
long before they were all taken out to see the new chickies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>Jeanette was a new wax doll, and like Henny, the Dutch doll, she could
say "Mamma" when anyone tipped her backward or forward. She had lovely
golden brown curls of real hair. It could be combed and braided, or
curled or fluffed without tangling, and Raggedy Ann was very proud when
Jeanette came to live with the dolls.</p>

<p>But now Raggedy Ann was very angry&mdash;in fact, Raggedy Ann had just ripped
two stitches out of the top of her head when she took her rag hands and
pulled her rag face down into a frown (but when she let go of the frown
her face stretched right back into her usual cheery smile).</p>

<p>And <i>you</i> would have been angry, too, for something had happened to
Jeanette.</p>

<p>Something or someone had stolen into the nursery that night when the
dolls were asleep and nibbled all the wax from Jeanette's beautiful
face&mdash;and now all her beauty was gone!</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 256px;">
<img src="images/s12b.jpg" width="256" height="400" alt="The mouse hole" title="The mouse hole" />
</div>

<p>"It really is a shame!" said Raggedy Ann as she put her arms about
Jeanette.</p>

<p>"Something must be done about it!" said the French doll as she stamped
her little foot.</p>

<p>"If I catch the culprit, I will&mdash;well, I don't know what I will do with
him!" said the tin soldier, who could be very fierce at times, although
he was seldom cross.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here is the hole he came from!" cried Uncle Clem from the other end of
the nursery. "Come, see!"</p>

<p>All the dolls ran to where Uncle Clem was, down on his hands and knees.</p>

<p>"This must be the place!" said Raggedy Ann. "We will plug up the hole
with something, so he will not come out again!"</p>

<p>The dolls hunted around and brought rags and pieces of paper and pushed
them into the mouse's doorway.</p>

<p>"I thought I heard nibbling last night," one of the penny dolls said.
"You know I begged for an extra piece of pie last evening, when Mistress
had me at the table and it kept me awake!"</p>

<p>While the dolls were talking, Marcella ran down-stairs with Jeanette and
told Daddy and Mamma, who came up-stairs with Marcella and hunted around
until they discovered the mouse's doorway.</p>

<p>"Oh, why couldn't it have chewed on me?" Raggedy Ann asked herself when
she saw Marcella's sorrowful face, for Raggedy Ann was never selfish.</p>

<p>"Daddy will take Jeanette down-town with him and have her fixed up as
good as new," said Mamma, so Jeanette was wrapped in soft tissue paper
and taken away.</p>

<p>Later in the day Marcella came bouncing into the nursery with a surprise
for the dolls. It was a dear fuzzy little kitten.</p>

<p>Marcella introduced the kitten to all the dolls.</p>

<p>"Her name is Boots, because she has four little white feet!" said
Marcella. So Boots, the happy little creature, played with the penny
dolls, scraping them over the floor and peeping out from behind chairs
and pouncing upon them as if they were mice and the penny dolls enjoyed
it hugely.</p>

<p>When Marcella was not in the nursery, Raggedy Ann wrestled with Boots
and they would roll over and over upon the floor, Boots with her front
feet around Raggedy Ann's neck and kicking with her hind feet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Boots would arch her back and pretend she was very angry and walk
sideways until she was close to Raggedy. Then she would jump at her and
over and over they would roll, their heads hitting the floor
bumpity-bump.</p>

<p>Boots slept in the nursery that night and was lonely for her Mamma, for
it was the first time she had been away from home.</p>

<p>Even though her bed was right on top of Raggedy Ann, she could not
sleep. But Raggedy Ann was very glad to have Boots sleep with her, even
if she was heavy, and when Boots began crying for her Mamma, Raggedy Ann
comforted her and soon Boots went to sleep.</p>

<p>One day Jeanette came home. She had a new coating of wax on her face and
she was as beautiful as ever.</p>

<p>Now, by this time Boots was one of the family and did not cry at night.
Besides Boots was told of the mouse in the corner and how he had eaten
Jeanette's wax, so she promised to sleep with one eye open.</p>

<p>Late that night when Boots was the only one awake, out popped a tiny
mouse from the hole. Boots jumped after the mouse, and hit against the
toy piano and made the keys tinkle so loudly it awakened the dolls.</p>

<p>They ran over to where Boots sat growling with the tiny mouse in her
mouth.</p>

<p>My! how the mouse was squeaking!</p>

<p>Raggedy Ann did not like to hear it squeak, but she did not wish
Jeanette to have her wax face chewed again, either.</p>

<p>So, Raggedy Ann said to the tiny little mouse, "You should have known
better than to come here when Boots is with us. Why don't you go out in
the barn and live where you will not destroy anything of value?"</p>

<p>"I did not know!" squeaked the little mouse, "This is the first time I
have ever been here!"</p>

<p>"Aren't you the little mouse who nibbled Jeanette's wax face?" Raggedy
Ann asked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>"No!" the little mouse answered. "I was visiting the mice inside the
walls and wandered out here to pick up cake crumbs! I have three little
baby mice at home down in the barn. I have never nibbled at anyone's wax
face!"</p>

<p>"Are you a Mamma mouse?" Uncle Clem asked.</p>

<p>"Yes!" the little mouse squeaked, "and if the kitten will let me go I
will run right home to my children and never return again!"</p>

<p>"Let her go, Boots!" the dolls all cried, "She has three little baby
mice at home! Please let her go!"</p>

<p>"No, sir!" Boots growled, "This is the first mouse I have ever caught
and I will eat her!" At this the little Mamma mouse began squeaking
louder than ever.</p>

<p>"If you do not let the Mamma mouse go, Boots, I shall not play with you
again!" said Raggedy Ann.</p>

<p>"Raggedy will not play with Boots again!" said all of the dolls in an
awed tone. Not to have Raggedy play with them would have been sad,
indeed.</p>

<p>But Boots only growled.</p>

<p>The dolls drew to one side, where Raggedy Ann and Uncle Clem whispered
together.</p>

<p>And while they whispered Boots would let the little Mamma mouse run a
piece, then she would catch it again and box it about between her paws.</p>

<p>This she did until the poor little Mamma mouse grew so tired it could
scarcely run away from Boots.</p>

<p>Boots would let it get almost to the hole in the wall before she would
catch it, for she knew it would not escape her.</p>

<p>As she watched the little mouse crawling towards the hole scarcely able
to move, Raggedy Ann could not keep the tears from her shoe-button eyes.</p>

<p>Finally as Boots started to spring after the little mouse again, Raggedy
Ann threw her rag arms around the kitten's neck. "Run, Mamma mouse!"
Raggedy Ann cried, as Boots whirled her over and over.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>Uncle Clem ran and pushed the Mamma mouse into the hole and then she was
gone.</p>

<p>When Raggedy Ann took her arms from around Boots, the kitten was very
angry. She laid her ears back and scratched Raggedy Ann with her claws.</p>

<p>But Raggedy Ann only smiled&mdash;it did not hurt her a bit for Raggedy was
sewed together with a needle and thread and if that did not hurt, how
could the scratch of a kitten? Finally Boots felt ashamed of herself and
went over and lay down by the hole in the wall in hopes the mouse would
return, but the mouse never returned. Even then Mamma mouse was out in
the barn with her children, warning them to beware of kittens and cats.</p>

<p>Raggedy Ann and all the dolls then went to bed and Raggedy had just
dozed off to sleep when she felt something jump upon her bed. It was
Boots. She felt a warm little pink tongue caress her rag cheek. Raggedy
Ann smiled happily to herself, for Boots had curled up on top of Raggedy
Ann and was purring herself to sleep.</p>

<p>Then Raggedy Ann knew she had been forgiven for rescuing the Mamma mouse
and she smiled herself to sleep and dreamed happily of tomorrow.</p>

<p>Marcella was having a tea party up in the nursery when Daddy called to
her, so she left the dollies sitting around the tiny table and ran down
stairs carrying Raggedy Ann with her.</p>

<p>Mama, Daddy and a strange man were talking in the living room and Daddy
introduced Marcella to the stranger.</p>

<p>The stranger was a large man with kindly eyes and a cheery smile, as
pleasant as Raggedy Ann's.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 255px;">
<img src="images/s13b.jpg" width="255" height="400" alt="The Ocean Fairies and Freddy" title="The Ocean Fairies and Freddy" />
</div>
<p>He took Marcella upon his knee and ran his fingers through her curls as
he talked to Daddy and Mamma, so, of course, Raggedy Ann liked him from
the beginning. "I have two little girls," he told Marcella. "Their names
are Virginia and Doris, and one time when we were at the sea-shore they
were playing in the sand and they covered up Freddy, Doris' boy-doll in
the sand. They were playing that Freddy was in bathing and that he
wanted to be covered with the clean white sand, just as the other
bathers did. And when they had covered Freddy they took their little
pails and shovels and went farther down the beach to play and forgot all
about Freddy.</p>

<p>"Now when it came time for us to go home, Virginia and Doris remembered
Freddy and ran down to get him, but the tide had come in and Freddy was
'way out under the water <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>and they could not find him. Virginia and
Doris were very sad and they talked of Freddy all the way home."</p>

<p>"It was too bad they forgot Freddy," said Marcella.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed it was!" the new friend replied as he took Raggedy Ann up
and made her dance on Marcella's knee. "But it turned out all right
after all, for do you know what happened to Freddy?"</p>

<p>"No, what did happen to him?" Marcella asked.</p>

<p>"Well, first of all, when Freddy was covered with the sand, he enjoyed
it immensely. And he did not mind it so much when the tide came up over
him, for he felt Virginia and Doris would return and get him.</p>

<p>"But presently Freddy felt the sand above him move as if someone was
digging him out. Soon his head was uncovered and he could look right up
through the pretty green water, and what do you think was happening? The
Tide Fairies were uncovering Freddy!</p>

<p>"When he was completely uncovered, the Tide Fairies swam with Freddy
'way out to the Undertow Fairies. The Undertow Fairies took Freddy and
swam with him 'way out to the Roller Fairies. The Roller Fairies carried
Freddy up to the surface and tossed him up to the Spray Fairies who
carried him to the Wind Fairies."</p>

<p>"And the Wind Fairies?" Marcella asked breathlessly.</p>

<p>"The Wind Fairies carried Freddy right to our garden and there Virginia
and Doris found him, none the worse for his wonderful adventure!"</p>

<p>"Freddy must have enjoyed it and your little girls must have been very
glad to get Freddy back again!" said Marcella. "Raggedy Ann went up in
the air on the tail of a kite one day and fell and was lost, so now I am
very careful with her!"</p>

<p>"Would you let me take Raggedy Ann for a few days?" asked the new
friend.</p>

<p>Marcella was silent. She liked the stranger friend, but she did not wish
to lose Raggedy Ann.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will promise to take very good care of her and return her to you in a
week. Will you let her go with me, Marcella?"</p>

<p>Marcella finally agreed and when the stranger friend left, he placed
Raggedy Ann in his grip.</p>

<p>"It is lonely without Raggedy Ann!" said the dollies each night.</p>

<p>"We miss her happy painted smile and her cheery ways!" they said.</p>

<p>And so the week dragged by....</p>

<p>But, my! What a chatter there was in the nursery the first night after
Raggedy Ann returned. All the dolls were so anxious to hug Raggedy Ann
they could scarcely wait until Marcella had left them alone.</p>

<p>When they had squeezed Raggedy Ann almost out of shape and she had
smoothed out her yarn hair, patted her apron out and felt her
shoe-button eyes to see if they were still there, she said, "Well, what
have you been doing? Tell me all the news!"</p>

<p>"Oh we have just had the usual tea parties and games!" said the tin
soldier. "Tell us about yourself, Raggedy dear, we have missed you so
much!"</p>

<p>"Yes! Tell us where you have been and what you have done, Raggedy!" all
the dolls cried.</p>

<p>But Raggedy Ann just then noticed that one of the penny dolls had a hand
missing.</p>

<p>"How did this happen?" she asked as she picked up the doll.</p>

<p>"I fell off the table and lit upon the tin soldier last night when we
were playing. But don't mind a little thing like that, Raggedy Ann,"
replied the penny doll. "Tell us of yourself! Have you had a nice time?"</p>

<p>"I shall not tell a thing until your hand is mended!" Raggedy Ann said.</p>

<p>So the Indian ran and brought a bottle of glue. "Where's the hand?"
Raggedy asked.</p>

<p>"In my pocket," the penny doll answered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/s13c.jpg" width="400" height="286" alt="Raggedy Ann and her sisters" title="Raggedy Ann and her sisters" />
</div>

<p>When Raggedy Ann had glued the penny doll's hand in place and wrapped a
rag around it to hold it until the glue dried, she said, "When I tell
you of this wonderful adventure, I know you will all feel very happy. It
has made me almost burst my stitches with joy."</p>

<p>The dolls all sat upon the floor around Raggedy Ann, the tin soldier
with his arm over her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Well, first when I left," said Raggedy Ann, "I was placed in the
Stranger Friend's grip. It was rather stuffy in there, but I did not
mind it; in fact I believe I must have fallen asleep, for when I
awakened I saw the Stranger Friend's hand reaching into the grip. Then
he lifted me from the grip and danced me upon his knee. 'What do you
think of her?' he asked to three other men sitting nearby.</p>

<p>"I was so interested in looking out of the window I did not pay any
attention to what they said, for we were on a train and the scenery was
just flying by! Then I was put back in the grip.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>"When next I was taken from the grip I was in a large, clean, light room
and there were many, many girls all dressed in white aprons.</p>

<p>"The stranger friend showed me to another man and to the girls who took
off my clothes, cut my seams and took out my cotton. And what do you
think! They found my lovely candy heart had not melted at all as I
thought. Then they laid me on a table and marked all around my outside
edges with a pencil on clean white cloth, and then the girls re-stuffed
me and dressed me.</p>

<p>"I stayed in the clean big light room for two or three days and nights
and watched my Sisters grow from pieces of cloth into rag dolls just
like myself!"</p>

<p>"Your SISTERS!" the dolls all exclaimed in astonishment, "What do you
mean, Raggedy?"</p>

<p>"I mean," said Raggedy Ann, "that the Stranger Friend had borrowed me
from Marcella so that he could have patterns made from me. And before I
left the big clean white room there where hundreds of rag dolls so like
me you would not have been able to tell us apart."</p>

<p>"We could have told <i>you</i> by your happy smile!" cried the French dolly.</p>

<p>"But all of my sister dolls have smiles just like mine!" replied Raggedy
Ann.</p>

<p>"And shoe-button eyes?" the dolls all asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, shoe-button eyes!" Raggedy Ann replied.</p>

<p>"I would tell you from the others by your dress, Raggedy Ann," said the
French doll, "Your dress is fifty years old! I could tell you by that!"</p>

<p>"But my new sister rag dolls have dresses just like mine, for the
Stranger Friend had cloth made especially for them exactly like mine."</p>

<p>"I know how we could tell you from the other rag dolls, even if you all
look exactly alike!" said the Indian doll, who had been thinking for a
long time.</p>

<p>"How?" asked Raggedy Ann with a laugh.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>"By feeling your candy heart! If the doll has a candy heart then it is
you, Raggedy Ann!"</p>

<p>Raggedy Ann laughed, "I am so glad you all love me as you do, but I am
sure you would not be able to tell me from my new sisters, except that I
am more worn, for each new rag doll has a candy heart, and on it is
written, '<i>I love you</i>' just as is written on my own candy heart."</p>

<p>"And there are hundreds and hundreds of the new rag dolls?" asked the
little penny dolls.</p>

<p>"Hundreds and hundreds of them, all named Raggedy Ann," replied Raggedy.</p>

<p>"Then," said the penny dolls, "we are indeed happy and proud for you!
For wherever one of the new Raggedy Ann dolls goes there will go with it
the love and happiness that <i>you</i> give to others."</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
